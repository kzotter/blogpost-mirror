# Keith Szot â€” Essays on Dedicated Device Solutions, Edge AI, and IT Operations

Hi there ðŸ‘‹ â€” Iâ€™m Keith. This repo is where I publish and mirror my writing on dedicated device solutions. My audience ranges from **IT Operations teams** on the front lines, to **CTOs and CPOs** setting strategy, and out across the broader ecosystem: **silicon vendors, ODMs, OEMs, IHVs, SIs, MSPs, solution providers, and ISVs**.  

The thread that ties it all together is **pragmatism over hype**. I want to give readers clear, grounded insight they can use to make decisions that matter â€” both for todayâ€™s deployments and for the road ahead.

## Why Iâ€™m doing this
Iâ€™ve always lived at the messy, fun intersection of **hardware and software**. Over the years Iâ€™ve designed systems, hacked together prototypes, chased down funding, built partnerships (and even a whole ecosystem or two), then got those ideas built, launched, and scaled.  

Iâ€™ve worked with just about everyone in the value chain: silicon vendors, component makers, ODMs, manufacturers, ISVs, OS teams, cloud providers, distributors, resellers, OEMs of every flavor. Iâ€™ve sat across the table from VCs, investors, and boards of directors. And Iâ€™ve worn a lot of hats myself: product, marketing, sales, presales, postsales, supportâ€¦ even CEO.  

The use cases Iâ€™ve touched run the gamut: consumer gadgets, Fortune 500 rollouts, and specialized verticals like retail, restaurants, and healthcare.  

Thatâ€™s why Esper feels like such a great fit. As the industryâ€™s leading **dedicated device management platform**, I get to dive into this wild mix of use cases, markets, and ecosystems every day. Itâ€™s a front-row seat to whatâ€™s possible.  

This repo is where I connect the dots. Past lessons, current challenges, and future opportunities â€” all in one place. **Read the essays, see what resonates, and if youâ€™re curious, give Esper a spin.** Iâ€™d love to hear what you think.
