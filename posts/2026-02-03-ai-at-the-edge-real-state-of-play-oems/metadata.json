  "summary": "A field guide for CTOs trying to operationalize edge AI in long-lived device fleets. The core decision isn't models; it's inference placement across endpoints, on-prem edge nodes, and cloud—bounded by OEM lifecycles, certification realities, and upgrade economics.",
  "excerpt": "If you are a CTO with an edge AI mandate and an installed base of devices, your first problem is not AI models, frameworks, or vendors. It's where inference runs and how much of your existing fleet you are willing, or able, to change.",
